# SNAK: Sisyphus Needed a Keyboard

## Credits

- The first version would not have been possible without [flatfootfox's](https://github.com/ImStuBTW) [Let's Design a Keyboard With Ergogen](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/) guide.
- Later versions were heavily inspired by [ceolide's](https://github.com/ceoloide) [corney-island](https://github.com/ceoloide/corney-island)
- Almost all footprints are from [infused-kim](https://github.com/infused-kim/kb_ergogen_fp)
